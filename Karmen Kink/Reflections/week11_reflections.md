Lecture:

In the first part of the lecture, Marlon Dumas talked about business process modeling.
It was an enjoyable "distraction" to our regular lectures and gave us another point of
view, or an alternative to consider. Then Ulno introduced a design pattern
and we had a small discussion on that.

Lab:

With our project team, we distributed tasks on our Kanban board among team
members, ensuring that everyone has tasks for the upcoming week. I will be
creating class and object diagrams using fulib (which also helps create
the data model in code). This session was much more productive than the
first two that we've had with the big team.
