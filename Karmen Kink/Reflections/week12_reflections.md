Lecture:
During the lecture, we discussed a couple of design patterns and then
had a presentation by Atul Kakar from Ncameo. I found it beneficial that
we were expected to prepare a bit before the presentation began, because
that gave us at least some primer. It was interesting to hear about the
workflow of such a company.

Lab:
We met up with our project team and discussed some aspects of data models,
some preferred workflow patterns, and distributed new task among team members.
We also agreed to meet once more during the week before the next lab to have
a clear understanding of the current status.
