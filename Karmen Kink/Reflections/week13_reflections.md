Lecture:

We discussed two design patterns, the last of them rather briefly. Then, Albert gave a
presentation about Fulib. It was good to see which possibilities Fulib holds besides the ones I
have used so far.

Lab:

We met with our project team. Product owner gave an overview of the current status, and also
showed what needs to be installed in order to run both back-end and front-end locally. That was
 helpful, because I had struggled with it for a while but now got the project to work.
