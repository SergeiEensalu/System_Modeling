Lecture:

Ishaya gave a summary of design patterns which I found beneficial because in the
previous lectures, we skimmed over them too quickly. Ulno introduced the requirements
for the final video. Adam Malik talked about his experience as a software developer,
which was the part I liked the most.

Lab:

I presented my (and group 8's more generally) portfolio in the instructor-talk channel.
According to the feedback from Ishaya, the portfolio is mostly good but some links should
be added. After the presentation, I joined the rest of the project team for a meeting. We
agreed on a time for discussing the structure of the video for the final presentation, and
talked a bit about component diagrams.
