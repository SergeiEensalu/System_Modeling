Lecture:

The lecture was rather introductory and did not delve deep into a specific topic. I liked that the lecturer dedicated time for introducing himself and the teaching assistant, plus we could consider our own expectations for the course. This gave me a better starting point for the weeks ahead.

Lab:

The organization was a bit hectic, but this is understandable for the first sessions. We managed to gather our group and started working on our repository and divided the tasks for next time.
