Lecture:

During the discussion in breakout rooms, we discussed pros and cons of class diagrams and selected two best pro
and two best contra arguments. In the last part of the lecture, following the video of Ulno implementing the classes on
a diagram in code, it was interesting to see how getter and setter functions were handled differently

Lab:

We discussed and created class diagrams, did not get to implementing them in Java but scheduled a time for the team to
meet and do the implementation of the last exercise together.
