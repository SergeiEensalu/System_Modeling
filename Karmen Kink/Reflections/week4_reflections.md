Lecture:

Learned about domain modelling, participated in a discussion about component diagrams as a note-taker, and
installed IntelliJ to follow the last part of the lecture. This time I felt like the actual theoretical part
of the lecture is too shallow, although we had a couple of slides on domain modelling. The structure of the
course is built in a way that we learn from the videos of other groups and just through trial-and-error,
which is something I would at times like but it should be accompanied with more content from the lecturer's side.

Lab:

Getting the project up and running on IntelliJ took more time than expected, as well as reminding myself of
some Java basics. This time there was just two people from our group and we decided to work individually, asking
questions and discussing when needed.
