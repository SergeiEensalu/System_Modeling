Lecture:
Discussion on use case diagrams and personas was pretty good, possibly it went better than some others because
use case diagrams and personas are encountered more often (or at least it was the case for me and some
other group members). In the end, there was a demonstration by Ulno about the model-view-controller design pattern.

Lab:
Created use case diagrams using creately.com, discussed a bit about personas for Mancala and ATM
tasks, and skimmed through the Mancala Controller exercise. Decided to schedule another time this week
for the last exercise to tackle it together.
