Lecture:

In the beginning, we discussed the general schedule of the course. It was a
relief to hear that we will not have additional lab exercises for the next weeks,
especially given that we are just about to prepare two videos in a row as well.
Then we had a short overview of state charts in Umple and Sismic, and after
that moved on to discussions. Our breakout room had a rather good discussion,
although not many solid cons were brought out - we were leaning more to the pro side.
Finally, ulno showed us a DIY model checker. 

Lab:

We started by discussing with Ulno about our presentation for the
next week. Among other information, he recommended some video editing
tools which was beneficial because none of our team members have
much experience with that. Ulno reminded us to add the lobby feature
to our Mancala implementation (both the controller and the GUI).
