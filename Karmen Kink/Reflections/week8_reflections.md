Lecture:

We had a small intro to domain driven design and a demo in the Miro environment of an event storming process.
It was quite fun to watch and think about how this approach could be used in my own work-related projects. Then we
moved on to activity diagram discussion, and after that had a demo from Ulno on building a model checker for
sismic state charts (garage door opener example).

Lab:

Worked on our presentation on deployment diagrams and had a chat with Ulno and Ishaya about some possible
additional pros, expectations for the portfolio and the video.
