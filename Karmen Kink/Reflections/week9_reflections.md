Lecture:

Discussion on deployment diagrams, project announcement
(a lot of new information in this respect), brief introduction
by ulno about the roles within project teams and expectations
of project outcomes. This week's lecture was pretty well structured.

Lab:

Within our "old" team, we worked on the exercises from lab 8 as we
used the lab time last week for working on our presentation. Then we
met with our new extended team to do event storming for the project
and discussed a bit about the distribution of roles.
