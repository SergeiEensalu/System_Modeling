#Reflections of Lecture 2

## Lecture Reflection
Lecture started with brief overview of last lecture and object diagram. I love the course organization of the lecture session 2. The first part started with lecture recording regarding transition from senario to story. It also involve discussion like previous lecture which involves interaction in discussion channel in discord regarding necessity of software architecture. In second part of lecture, We have discussion regarding object diagram in breakout for 30 minutes. After breakout session, the course begin with how a user stories can be transformed into objects. The last part of the course introduced tools for creating models. We acquired brief knowledge of tools like Plant-uml and Fulib which are helpful to create models.

## Lab Reflection
The lab session is dedicated to conversion of user scenario task exercise into object diagram via Plant-uml and Fulib tools.
