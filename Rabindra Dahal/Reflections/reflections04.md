#Reflections of Lecture 4
## Note
I could not attend the Lecture and lab due to my health problems. So, I rewatch the lectures and made the reflections.
## Lecture Reflection
Lecture started with brief overview of last lecture regarding class diagram. I learned about the component diagrams and fulib generation tools.

## Lab Reflection
The lab session provided us exercises to be done in team that help to understand the component diagrams and class diagrams. I could not complete the task
assigned to me on time due to my health problems. I completed it lately and submitted it in task folder that were assigned to me.
