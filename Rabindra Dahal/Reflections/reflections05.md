#Reflections of Lecture 5
## Note
I could not attend the Lecture and lab due to my health problems. So, I rewatch the lectures and made the reflections.
## Lecture Reflection
Lecture started with brief overview of last lecture regarding component diagram. I learned about the use case diagrams and personas modeling.

## Lab Reflection
The lab session provided us exercises to be done in team that help to understand the use case diagrams and personas modeling.
