# Research Records - Session 03

## Interaction - Revision of class diagrams based on movie resources

A poll was organized in the class that aims to find and discuss the problem seen in the diagram from the class diagram pros and cons movie resources.
Q1. I selected there is problem with association because there was no underline in object diagram.
Q2. I selected there is problem with attributes and object names because there was no underline in object diagram and object name do not start with lower case.
Q3. I selected there is problem with associations and object names because there was no underline in object diagram and object name do not start with lower case.
Q4. I selected there is problem with associations and choices of object semantics because there was no underline in object diagram and object name start with lower case.

# Understanding from the movie resources regarding pros and cons of class diagram
# Class Diagram 
 - Class diagrams show classes within the system, their attributes with types and their  cardinality relationships.
 - helps to generalize objects diagram and convey information more concisely.
 - allows for clean transformations like going to and from code as well as to database diagrams.
 - inevitably important in software development.
 - best way to describe the nature of system in details.
 - most important kind of UML diagram.

# Pros of class diagram
 - Provides detailed insight of system.
 - Helps to plan out how different classes have to interact with each other.
 - Provides one on one mapping with the implementation layer.
 - Very concise and expressive.
 - Easy to turn to code and can be generated from the code.
 - Easy to maintain i.e easy to add new classes,easy to modify the attributes of the classes,easy to add the hierarchy to existing classes.
 - Good for structuring data.
 - Localized code update and non local side effect.

# Cons of class diagram
 - Due to connection between more classes,it becomes unreadable.
 - Notation can get messy and complicated if we donot know relationship,aggregation,composition etc.
 - Inheritance is evil because it is easy to change something in base class and have unintended side effect in sub classes.
 - Making classes unnecessaryily complex cannot express all the complexity of system that we wish to model.
 - Often overlooked.
 - Poor aesthetics i.e lines crossed,classes too far from each other,inappropriately positioned multiplicities.
 - Cardinalities i.e infinite cyclic association.

# Finding
 Although class diagram are easy to understand but notation can get messy and complicated if we donot have background of computer science like stakeholders.
