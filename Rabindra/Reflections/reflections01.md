#Reflections of day 1

## Lecture Reflection
Lecture was started with brief overview of what will be learned studying 
Systems Modeling along with instructions necessary to obtain a good grade.
The lecture was interactive. We have to answer the question provided by
lecturer in limited time frame. The answer needed to be posted on
BlueButtons and Discord discussion group. I have not been familiar with 
such teaching style; I have to constantly switch from BlueButtons to Discord
more often and I was confused where to post the answer asked by lecturer.

## Lab Reflection
The lab session started with lab guidelines and group formations for student
who do not have formed the group.
