# Lecture 10
## Homework
Read some stuff about story driven modeling. I think the paper was pretty confusing. There were huge pieces of text next to the stories, I didn't understand if they were part of the story as well or just an explanation. Also names and times don't seem to provide much value in my opinion. Lately I've used gherkin a lot and I like the structure and step by step instructions and believe that this is a far more superior way to write down requirements. Not to mention that you can use them for functional/acceptance testing. 

## Lecture

### Some lecture specific section

We need design patterns to speed up development and ease maintenace by standardizing code structure
Ulnos answers just to keep in mind: Maintainability, extensibility, changeability

We could use strategy patterns when there would be a lot of if else statements, different roles doing different actions, different ways to notify users (select email, SMS, fax :D).

Composite patterns in bank should be used when handling objects that are part of the same hierarchy the same when they are different. Don't really know how that would be useful in the bank project.

### Feedback for the lecture
I liked the lecture. When talking about the design patterns, it would be beneficial to mention what problems they solve before going in to details about how to implement them.
