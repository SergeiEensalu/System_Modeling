# Lecture 11

## Guest lecture
I really enjoyed the guest lecture. I liked how Marlon started explaining business process modeling with a simple example and then added more complicated notations on top of that. All that when explaining it in a context of a nice real world example, that really brought out the difficulties of designing processes for enterprises. He definitely made me consider taking that course next semester.

### BPM discussion
I think it would not be easier to code the business process since the model can be produced based on multiple people's knowledge about different parts of the process. More complicated processes would be very dificult to code. Also coding doesn't visualise the process and doesn't document it. 
I don't think BPM would have been useful in this class.
I think BPM is quite similar to flow-charts and activity diagrams
### Visitor pattern
1. You still have to write the functionality multiple times
2. Don't really see why it would be useful in the bank project.
3. From the example I didn't really understand what the visitor is used for or what problem it solves
### Feedback for the lecture
Amazing guest lecture and nice Q&A after that. Also nice that we will have a nice little overview of design patters. Even though there is no way I remember them exactly, maybe when I encounter a problem mentioned in this course, a light bulb turns on and I remember that I should check if a design pattern exists to solve the problem.
