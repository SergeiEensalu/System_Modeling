# Lecture 12

### Observer pattern discussion
1. Have to use inheritance, can add complexity and reduce performance
2. Send a newsletter to all users who have enabled newsletters
3. Usually you would use this when you have multiple objects that depend on the same one object. For example someone posts a message on a board that are observed by multiple users. So the system would go over all observers and notify them.

### Command pattern discussion
1. A lot of classes: one for each command
2. As Mike said: Could be used to register operations in offline mode and update when it gets network connectivity. (I couldn't come up with an example)
3. I guess it's usefult when you need to schedule different actions, that are related to multiple different entities and you can handle them the same way. The logic can be entirely different. 
## Guest lecture - NCAMEO
### Pre lecture research
1. Creating applications by not coding I assume
2. RAD development, drag and drop forms, mobile apps and more
3. I expect them to promise that it is multiple times easier to develop their way but in reality this platform doesn't offer as much flexibility as promised

### During lecture
1. It's clever to show image of the system first, so you can get a lot more accurate requirements from the client
2. Is the database generated based on the forms?
3. I guess Ncameos no code environment would be helpful when designing user interfaces in the bank app since it looked pretty simple

### Feedback for the lecture
I really liked this guest lecture as well. I liked how he was very honest and upfront about the finances and how he is able to hire developers straight out of college. The Ulno part of the lecture was nice also and Ulno had very good questions for the guest. Nice that Ulno has been able to get us these very different but very insightful lecturers.
