# Lecture 13

### Singleton pattern discussion
1. There can be some problems with singleton depending on the use case or the service that is implemented as a singleton. They make testing hard also
2. Database connection

## Guest lecture Albert ZÃ¼ndorf
Before
1. Didn't do much with fulib so hard to say, I guess it does what it promises
2. No opinion basically, I don't really see myself using fulib very much

During
1. The mockups generator, but this seems more work that creating the pages manually from scratch. Also it seems like clients would be really dissappointed with the mockups. They should look like they are drawn or something so it would be clear that they are mockups.
2. I don't see any cases like this at the moment
3. The learning curve of this tool is too steep to just pick it up and use. I think you have to study the tool for hours before it is usable and this probably scares new users away. I think a nice contrast to that is using cucumber. The gherkin syntax is really easy and for example setting it up is also simple and it generates all the steps for you (you just have to fill in the blanks). I know they are different tools for different purposes but the problems seem similar (new syntax for specification, code generation, new kind of workflow), it's a bit complicated work flow for a new user but it's extremely easy to pick up in the case of cucumber. Not so easy with fulib.

After
1. I think I wouldn't have liked to do more work with fulib.
### Feedback for the lecture
I really didn't care much about this lecture not because of the lecturers, but because I don't see myself using that tool very much in the future.
