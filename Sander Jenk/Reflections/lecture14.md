# Lecture 14

### Pick 2 favourite design patterns
* Singleton - it's the easiest to understand
* Observer - simply because I have used it in angular (rxjs library) and it has been quite fun to use
## Guest lecture - Systems Modeling In Real Life (Adam Malik)
* What was most impressive, particular, insightful in Adam's history and
current way of work?  
I like how much he is focused on the role of people in the process of modelling software. 
* One question regarding architectural or modeling elements in his work.  
Which UML diagrams do you use in your work?
* What is Adam's opinion on No-code frameworks/development and do you share it or oppose it – why?  
Adams' opinion is that no-code is for very specific problems and requirements and outside of that it can create a lot of headache.  
I see all frameworks and ways of doing things as tools and choosing the tool depends on the task. If no-code achieves the same thing as code but 2 times cheaper and quicker and the solution doesn't have to be very scalable and doesn't have to evolve into a bigger project, then I find it a better solution obviously.
* What is Adam's opinion on modeling and working with modeling in the university context, what role did this play for his future career? Do you share or oppose his opinion – why?  
Doesn't use UML models, which is quite understandable. I don't share the opinion to that extent but I also don't have much experience with modeling in a real life scenario and in a context of a larger team.
### Feedback for the lecture
I really liked this lecture. Ishaya did a good job concluding the design pattern section. The guest lecture was really good with a lot of real life examples. He explained well how you have to communicate with different roles in a software project as a software architect and how to get the most information out of people.
