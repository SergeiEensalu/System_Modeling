# Lecture 15

## 7_11
* I like the usage of stock footage, the presentation is very nice and I like the background music.
* The design of the app is very weird, I don't like the colours
* Funny special gambling feature

## 2_6_8
* By far the best application and the best team. I think this app is amazing and probably production ready and ready to make billions. 

## 3_12
* The presentation, especially the console commands were hard to follow
* The design of the website is kinda poor

## 4_9
* Nice UI and cool special feature.

## 5_10
* Nice that they showed team members. Nicely designed UI. Overall a very good presentation

## 13_14
* Unique special feature. A solid implementation of the bank app
