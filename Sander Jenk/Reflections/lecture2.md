# Lecture 2 homework
## Object diagram movie
1. Object diagram pros  
Gives a good overview of objects and their state during some system behaviour. Useful for testing - can visualise a state of different edge cases

2. Object diagram cons  
Difficult to select objects that are relevant in the behaviour and also there's a significant code-model cap because object diagrams use a subset of objects and their properties. 
3. Makes sense  
To use mapping out smaller concrete examples of behaviour of objects
4. Doesn't make sense   
To use them on a giant project to describe a behaviour, that includes a lot of objects, it just gets too messy
5. Movie Thoughts  
Pro movie: I liked the music on the background. Also it was very fluidly scripted.  
Con movie: I liked the exaggerated gif-s that helped to emphasize the cons. 

# Lecture

## Breakout, object diagram, group E
I added to the first argument by saying that object diagrams give a good overview and they are easily understandable.
I also challenged 2 pros - first person pointed out that they are easy to scale but in the cons it was mentioned that it was not good for larger projects and so I asked if this could be explained. The answer was that it doesn't scale up as well as down. The pros contained a point that said that is is easy to add and delete objects but the con said that that they are difficult to refactor. So it looked like they contradicted each other. 

## Feedback for the lecture
The lecture was really good, nice amount of info and interactivity. The breakout was not as unexpected and since the timeframe was a lot bigger, there was enough time to organise, get settled and start with the discussion.
