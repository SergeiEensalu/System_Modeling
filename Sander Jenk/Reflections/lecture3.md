# Lecture 2 
## Homework
### Group 7: Class diagram pro movie
1. Strongest argument  
1:1 mapping to the implementation layer so it can be generated from code and vice versa
2. Movie Thoughts  
Movie had a nice beat on the background.

### Group 6 & 2: Class diagram con movie
1. Strongest argument  
The diagrams can be extremely complicated with all their relationships especially in a bigger project
2. Movie Thoughts  
They have a long argument about the murdercleaningcatrobotdog poop, that really isn't a flaw of the class diagram, but rather the implementation.

### Group 12: Class diagram pro movie
1. Strongest argument  
Good overview of the system, classes and their relationships. Good to use when planning the system
2. Movie Thoughts  
Pretty clear and concise movie 


### My thoughts on the diagram
1. Pro  
As a developer, it is pretty simple to implement classes in code based on a class diagram, especially when the project uses code first  approaches (db generated from classes).
2. Con  
Complexity of inheritance, cardinalities
3. Makes sense to use  
When planning the system
4. Doesn't make sense to use  
Maybe maintaining a class diagram of an existing or legacy system doesn't make sense since the project is probably grown in size and complexity


## Lecture

### Weird diagrams
1. I think it is weird that player is between the deck and the cards, Inheritance arrows - Associations
2. Forking associations look weird - Associations
3. Circular associations are almost never nesseccary, Jane shouldn't be object class - Associations, Names
4. Choice of objects - there probably shouldn't be multiple transactions but rather the state of the transactions should change in different steps; circular associations are almost never nesseccary - Choice of objects, Associations

### Breakout, object diagram
I provided the first pro saying that you can generate code from class diagrams and it is possible to do it vice versa - generate diagrams based on code

### Feedback for the lecture
The lecture was good, breakouts went pretty smoothly. There was a bit confusion with the new google docs format (make a copy and then edit etc) so the person who had to log stuff was a bit behind.

### Feedback for the lab
We managed to do half the exercises during the lab. One problem we had was that none of us uses java that much so the diagram generation exercises are pretty difficult for us. We didn't have IDE-s for java so we couldn't start with these. I actually really enjoy making the diagrams and plantUML makes it quite nice. I didn't really see the point of the last exercise since it was just a coding exercise, rather than a modeling one. It was annoying to use IDE and language that I don't use. Also the part with the assert statement was not clear for me.
