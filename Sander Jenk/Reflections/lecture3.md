# Lecture 2 
## Homework
### Group 7: Class diagram pro movie
1. Strongest argument  
1:1 mapping to the implementation layer so it can be generated from code and vice versa
2. Movie Thoughts  
Movie had a nice beat on the background.

### Group 6 & 2: Class diagram con movie
1. Strongest argument  
The diagrams can be extremely complicated with all their relationships especially in a bigger project
2. Movie Thoughts  
They have a long argument about the murdercleaningcatrobotdog poop, that really isn't a flaw of the class diagram, but rather the implementation.

### Group 12: Class diagram pro movie
1. Strongest argument  
Good overview of the system, classes and their relationships. Good to use when planning the system
2. Movie Thoughts  
Pretty clear and concise movie 


### My thoughts on the diagram
1. Pro  
As a developer, it is pretty simple to implement classes in code based on a class diagram, especially when the project uses code first  approaches (db generated from classes).
2. Con  
Complexity of inheritance, cardinalities
3. Makes sense to use  
When planning the system
4. Doesn't make sense to use  
Maybe maintaining a class diagram of an existing or legacy system doesn't make sense since the project is probably grown in size and complexity
