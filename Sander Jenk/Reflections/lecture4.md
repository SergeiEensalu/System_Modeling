# Lecture 4
## Homework
### Group 14 component diagram movie
1. Strongest argument
Useful when designing device, which has input output socket (no explanation given so I don't actually understand)
2. Movie Thoughts
The example in the movie looks extremely compicated (books for everyone), especially the ports since I don't think they add any value to the diagram. Also they didn't provide any pros in their movie, which is pretty funny exept fot the last slide which didn't have an explanation.

### Group 4 component diagram movie
1. Strongest argument
Also doesn't mention pro-s straightforwardly, but instead shows some examples.
2. Movie Thoughts
Really good overview of the compositions and good and simple examples of component diagrams
### Group 12 component diagram movie
1. Strongest argument
Difficult to maintain in dynamic systems
2. Movie Thoughts
I'm sure the coding example was pretty advanced but I didn't understand it at all. 
### Group 13 component diagram movie
1. Strongest argument
Sometimes too abstract, sometimes too technical and detailed
2. Movie Thoughts
Don't really agree with their synonymity con. I think it's good to have different ways to show same stuff (you can choose to be more or less detailed)
### Personal thoughts about the component diagram
1. Personal pro  
I don't know where I would use this. I guess it gives an overview of the system but I don't know who it really benefits. Maybe as a complementary diagram to show a bit more abstraction than class diagram for development. But that would mean more diagrams to maintain for the team. So the answer is: I don't know.
2. Personal con  
Don't contain enough information to use for development, also not abstract enough to give a good overview of the project
3. Makes sense to use  
Makes sense to use in a smaller software project or for a part of the system, where using class diagrams would not be enough
4. Doesn't make sense to use  
Doesn't make sense to use in a big project to display all the system at once, makes it too complicated
