# Lecture 4
## Homework
### Group 1 use case diagram movie
1. Strongest argument  
Help understand functional requirements; bridge between software developers and end users
2. Movie Thoughts  
The example was a bit long and there wasn't a need for it.
### Group 3 use case diagram movie
1. Strongest argument
Easy to use; Helps design tests
2. Movie Thoughts
I'm not sure if I agree with the "prevents bad UX" pro. Doesn't really make sense
### Group 11 use case diagram movie
1. Strongest argument
Time consuming; Getting needless data(?); Easily outdated; False information
2. Movie Thoughts
I don't really agree with many of the points in this movie. Most seem to be problems if the diagrams are really badly done, but I think these diagrams are not that hard to make or maintain and they are understandable for everyone and difficult to misinterpret
### Group 11 use case diagram movie
1. Strongest argument
Persona modeling is expensive; doesn't display non functional aspects; logic and linear which;leaves details out; 
2. Movie Thoughts
I agree with the fact that persona modeling is expensive and time consuming. I don't agree with the leaves details out (point about code having loops and if-else statements, that are not displayed in the diagram), it is not supposed to be that detailed
### Personal thoughts about the component diagram
1. Personal pro  
I think that the main pro is that it is a good high level diagram, that is understandable for users and non-technical people
2. Personal con  
It can get visually messy, when you have extended use cases and extended actors etc and a lot of use cases, lines tend to overlap etc
3. Makes sense to use  
Makes sense to use when explaining the system to non-technical people
4. Doesn't make sense to use  
If you don't need a high level diagram and if the target audience for the diagram are developers only etc.
