# Lecture 6
## Homework
### group 14 sequence diagram pro  movie
1. Strongest argument  
Can complement use case diagram for example, more detailed data, for example can contain loops, conditionals, parallel execution.  
Good abstraction level for design meetings, concrete and detailed but leaves out unnecessary info (kinda vague I think, not well explained)   
Kood way to coordinate between teams (for example interacting components of the same system that have to interact)
Integrates passage of time
2. Movie Thoughts  
I liked this movie because it focused on the pro-s not just explaining the diagram. Also the examples had nice amount of complexity, enough to display the power of the diagram, but understandable
### group 10 sequence diagram pro diagram movie
1. Strongest argument  
Timing and order of interactions.   
Validate class diagrams against use cases.   
Shows message flow.
2. Movie Thoughts  
Really cringy beginning, I like it. Don't know if the accent is a parody or not. Video format is nice and interactive.
### group 9 sequence diagram con movie
1. Strongest argument  
Cannot represent every condition (fair enough, which one can though?). Horizontal spacing problem (sounds a bit of a pseudo-problem). Much time, too large, hard to read bla bla bla (it seems like every diagram has these problems)
2. Movie Thoughts  
I think a lot of the con movies suffer the same stuff, they show that if you use them incorrectly, then you will have bad diagrams, which makes sense but it isn't really a con of the diagram
### group 14 sequence diagram con movie
1. Strongest argument  
Horizontal space problem.  
A nice point is that instead of planning an algorithm in sequence diagram, you could have programmed the algorithm in the same timeframe. Oudated, forget to update, too complex bla bla bla (also a problem with all the diagrams in the world).  
Concurrency something something  
2. Movie Thoughts
Nice and concise movie. A lot of points again about the problems that are not worth mentioning in my opinion.
### Personal thoughts about the {diagramtype} diagram
1. Personal pro  
Shows the timing and order of interactions, because this is the first diagram we learn which has time integrated in it and it seems like it can be a powerful tool
2. Personal con  
I really liked the point that programming the algorithm would take similar amount of time to planning the sequence diagram
3. Makes sense to use
Specific use cases where displaying order of events and interactions seems necessary
4. Doesn't make sense to use  
There are probably a lot of cases where using it doesn't make sense.

## Lecture
### Other artifacts for communtication with client
* I like the idea of prototypes and documentation and manuals seem useful but developers creating documentation seems unrealistic.
### Breakout
I provided the most basic pro that the integration on timing and order of interactions is a powerful tool. Also challenged a point which said that lifelines can be in random order by saying that as a creator of the diagram you can choose a logical order for your lifelines. Also someone mentioned that they complement use case diagrams but it is a lot of work to have a sequence diagram for every use case. I challenged that by asking if it is really necessary to have a sequence diagram about every use case even if using sequence diagram over some other diagram wouldn't provide any additional value.
### Feedback for the lecture
Nothing bad to say again, interesting lecture, I liked the poll part again to ask about other student's experiences. The breakout went relatively smoothly.

### Lab reflections
I did the mancala GUI task and used Angular to solve it. This lab was nice and manageable, 3 really concise and understandable tasks.
