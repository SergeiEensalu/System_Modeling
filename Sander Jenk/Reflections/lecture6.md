## Homework
### group 14 sequence diagram pro  movie
1. Strongest argument  
Can complement use case diagram for example, more detailed data, for example can contain loops, conditionals, parallel execution.  
Good abstraction level for design meetings, concrete and detailed but leaves out unnecessary info (kinda vague I think, not well explained)   
Kood way to coordinate between teams (for example interacting components of the same system that have to interact)
Integrates passage of time
2. Movie Thoughts  
I liked this movie because it focused on the pro-s not just explaining the diagram. Also the examples had nice amount of complexity, enough to display the power of the diagram, but understandable
### group 10 sequence diagram pro diagram movie
1. Strongest argument  
Timing and order of interactions.   
Validate class diagrams against use cases.   
Shows message flow.
2. Movie Thoughts  
Really cringy beginning, I like it. Don't know if the accent is a parody or not. Video format is nice and interactive.
### group 9 sequence diagram con movie
1. Strongest argument  
Cannot represent every condition (fair enough, which one can though?). Horizontal spacing problem (sounds a bit of a pseudo-problem). Much time, too large, hard to read bla bla bla (it seems like every diagram has these problems)
2. Movie Thoughts  
I think a lot of the con movies suffer the same stuff, they show that if you use them incorrectly, then you will have bad diagrams, which makes sense but it isn't really a con of the diagram
### group 14 sequence diagram con movie
1. Strongest argument  
Horizontal space problem.  
A nice point is that instead of planning an algorithm in sequence diagram, you could have programmed the algorithm in the same timeframe. Oudated, forget to update, too complex bla bla bla (also a problem with all the diagrams in the world).  
Concurrency something something  
2. Movie Thoughts
Nice and concise movie. A lot of points again about the problems that are not worth mentioning in my opinion.
### Personal thoughts about the {diagramtype} diagram
1. Personal pro  
Shows the timing and order of interactions, because this is the first diagram we learn which has time integrated in it and it seems like it can be a powerful tool
2. Personal con  
I really liked the point that programming the algorithm would take similar amount of time to planning the sequence diagram
3. Makes sense to use
Specific use cases where displaying order of events and interactions seems necessary
4. Doesn't make sense to use  
There are probably a lot of cases where using it doesn't make sense.
