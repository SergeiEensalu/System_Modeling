# Lecture 7
## Homework
### group 9 state diagram pro movie
1. Strongest argument
Model checking, testing: generating code from state diagrams; good for finding errors (not explained enough)
2. Movie Thoughts  
Model checking is a nice argument. Good detailed movie.
### group 11 state diagram diagram pro movie
1. Strongest argument
Make system behavour visible and understandable, easy to visualise complex systems, model checking, non-technical roles understand
2. Movie Thoughts
Creepy and suspicious elevator music on the background
### group 7 state diagram con movie
1. Strongest argument
Notation and formalism, differenct notations exist and that makes it easy to create an incorrect diagram; state explosion: a lot of new states makes diagram unreadable (have to know parrallel states, hierarchy, guards)
2. Movie Thoughts
Short and concise movie with good examples
### group 10 state diagram diagram movie
1. Strongest argument
Complexity of larger systems; activity diagram might be a better idea; No concurrency; Only for showing states
2. Movie Thoughts
Nice editing
### Personal thoughts about the state diagram diagram
1. Personal pro    
I like the pro that it produces less bugs, I don't know how or why but this is a nice advantage
2. Personal con   
I liked the point about state explosion, you have to know more complex notations 
3. Makes sense to use  
Makes sense to use for cases where the system has clearly defined states (and finite number of states)
4. Doesn't make sense to use    
Any other case

## Lecture
### Some lecture specific section
Why Ulno fires recursion users: If Ulno used functional languages, he would not have any employees (we have a functional programming class and basically everything is recursion). Recursion allows you to remove side effects from problems and make your code more expressive and readable. So maybe Ulno hates readable and clean code and having employees? (It's a joke obviously)
### Breakout
I provided a challenge for a point that said that state diagrams are hard to maintain. I said that it can be probably said about every diagram out there and by not explaining it further, the argument doesn't provide much value. I think I provided a more detailed answer: A lot of new states makes diagram unreadable and to avoid that you would have to know more difficult notations in state diagrams like parallel states, hierarchy, guards
### Feedback for the lecture
Nice lecture, the model checker stuff is complicated. Breakout room went well.

### Reflections for the lab
Thankfully we didn't have exercises for our lab so we could focus on working on our video. We had a nice chat with Ulno about editing techniques and programs and how to make the con movie.
