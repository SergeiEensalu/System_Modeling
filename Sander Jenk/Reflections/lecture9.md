# Lecture 9
## Homework
### Group 8 deployment diagram pro movie
1. Strongest argument  
All of them
2. Movie Thoughts  
For the second week in a row it seems like there is a video, that is one of the best ones ever made.
### deployment diagram movie
1. Strongest argument
No standard for visual stereotypes. No way to show security. Problems showing cloud application. Mixed abstraction levels. Glorified object diagrams.
2. Movie Thoughts
I don't agree with many of their points. Mixed abstraction levels or having software and hardware on the same diagram doesn't make sense as a con when talking about deployment, since deployment is related to both. Maybe looking at the diagram in vacuum, then you minght think that. Also the point: glorified object diagram doesn't make much sence to me. Deployment diagram is a lot more abstract when displaying the logic, it's main focus is deployment, so you can't display something like that with object diagrams. No way to show security: I don't know why or how it should. 
### Personal thoughts about the {diagramtype} diagram
1. Personal pro  
I like the prot that it bridges knowledge between sysadmins and developers and business roles.
2. Personal con  
I think it is a fair con that it might be difficult to show deployments to cloud
3. Makes sense to use  
When you have multiple services deployed to multiple servers
4. Doesn't make sense to use  
If you have a monolith, that lives in one server
## Lecture
### What different scrum roles should do
Product owner - make sure that scrum master and achitects understand the requirements
Scrum master - assigning tasks, that fit developers the best, basically to understand everyones skills and preferences and making compromises; chooses the task management software and refining the backlog and it's workflow
Architecture owner - decides on the technology stack based on the skills of the developers and the task at hand, decides on the design patterns and assures that developers have enough knowledge about the requirements, by providing diagrams that explain diffenent processes and use cases
### Breakout room 2
Breakout was difficult, I chose to be the moderator again because I made one of the videos. Half of the people weren't connected with microphones and the other half didn't want to speak. Also people discovered the drawing tools so they focused more on that.
### Feedback for the lecture
The project seems again like an overkill for systems modeling course. A lot more programming heavy than other courses that are more programming related.
