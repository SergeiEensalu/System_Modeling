## Breakout

###  Opening Notes
We will discuss deployment diagrams. 

###  First Person Pro Notes 
Diagrams provide a view of hardware and software together. You can understand from the first view scalability, maintainability and portability. 
###  Second Person Con Notes 
They can easily get outdated. When you rename artefact then it is an example to be outdated. Or change anything in the DB. easy to update but as well it can easily get outdated.
###  Third Person Pro Notes
Clear interface of interaction between different components. Mock components can be used for the system under development. Without a real implementation a development structure can be visualised. 
###  Fourth Person Con Notes
Dep diagrams don't have visual standards. No notation standardization. Labor-intensive.
###  Fifth Person Pro Notes 
Deployment Diagrams help define non-functional requirements: Portability, maintainability and etc. 
###  Sixth Person Con Notes 
Dep diagrams don't support cloud applications. Since they are becoming more and widely used these days.
###  Moderator Summary Notes
Positive: Deployment diagrams provide a nice view of hard and software together. They allow developing the system easier because you can already have the system view before developing it. 
Negative: no visual standart, no notation standard, labour intensive, does not support cloud apps.
###  Round 1 Person Challenge/Question Notes
Against First Person Pro & fifth person pro. There are so many errors that can arise from hardware and software in different ways. You can't just rely on a deployment diagram 100%. Diagrams will explode in size.
###  Round 1 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes
Need them to explain the entirety of a system. For more in-depth views use different diagrams.
###  Round 2 Person Challenge/Question Notes for Fourth Person Con Notes
Why is it not okay that they don't have standardization? What is the negative part about this?
###  Round 2 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes 
But maybe as a stakeholder i don't know IT related anything how can i build it then without standardization. How can I do anything without instructions. There is no certain standardization. 
###  Round 3 Person Challenge/Question Notes 
Against Second Person Con: Every diagram can be easily outdated anyway. 
###  Round 3 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes
No defense. 

###  2 Best For
Point 1: Easy to connect and substitute components according to their interfaces, easy to use with mock components in the development stage.
Point 2: Diagrams provide a view of hardware and software together. You can understand from the first view scalability, maintainability and portability. 

###  2 Best Against
Point 1: Dep diagrams don't have visual standards. No notation standardization. Labor-intensive.
Point 2: Dep diagrams don't support cloud applications. Since they are becoming more and widely used these days.
