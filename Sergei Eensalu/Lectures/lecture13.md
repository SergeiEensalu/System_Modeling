# Lecture 13

### Singleton pattern discussion
- Singleton is good to have a single instance of an object in a project. 
- When you update the singleton, you also have to update all the uses in all places, and if you forget to replace the code somewhere the application will crash.
- Using singletons hides the dependencies of your application in your code, instead of exposing them through the interfaces

Before
did not even hear what it is

During
- Fulib is a library that provides code generation for UML like models and some model management functionalities
- Using a domain-specific language provided by Java APIs, it allows you to define classes, attributes and associations with a meta model
- From the meta model definition, Fulib can automatically generate Java code. The generated code ensures referential integrity and can optionally include support for property change listeners or JavaFX.

After
not sure what I will use in the future
