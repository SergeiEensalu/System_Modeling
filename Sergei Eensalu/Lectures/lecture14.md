Top 2 design patterns:

- Decorator pattern. I think  allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.
- Builder pattern. I think is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming

**Systems Modeling in Real Life by Adam Malik**
#### 1. What was most impressive, particular, insightful in Adam's history and current way of work?

    Last his project: ERP in medical domain. This project was difficult enough. And also the used large Miro boarding was very 
    impressive

#### 2. One question regarding architectural or modeling elements in his work
    
    Why did you use these particular methods for creating model diagrams

#### 3. What is Adam's opinion on No-code frameworks/development and do you share it or oppose it? Why?

    He believes that it is not always possible to cope with only frameworks or only code. Usually, one thing helps the other, and individually, these things make life harder.

#### 4. What is Adam's opinion on modeling and working with modeling in the university context, what role did this play for his future career? Do you share or oppose his opinion - why?
    all parts of the software must be understandable to every member of the team and to every person who will ever cross over to the code of this software
    Adam does not use ULM diagrams in real life, he uses alternative options. Adam claims UML diagrams helped him start thinking abstractly
 
#### 5. Optional: any other question/remark
     Was very interesting to listen
