# Lecture 15

In this lecture we looked at each team's draft and discussed what is good and what could be better. Below are my opinions on the projects of different groups:

### Team1_11_17 "Seven Eleven"
-  ##### What you like?
Accurate and polite presentation. Everything is explained in great detail and shown. Very good video editing
- ##### What do you dislike? 
There was no information about the organization of the team. There was also no information how many stages were in the project, how quickly one or the other part was developed, and so on.

### Team2_6_8 "Awesome Bank" (my team)
-  ##### What you like?
we tried to make our presentation funny, so that people would smile and for this we used various funny stories about theft and so on. I hope people liked our idea.
- ##### What do you dislike? 
We thought that the functional "request for money" would be a very unique thing for us, but as it turned out, it was not such a unique thing, because almost everyone did the same. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the request for money through banks in Estonia is so popular that it has become a common thing

### Team3_12
-  ##### What you like?
The guys are great, they did a great job and the video turned out to be very funny, a very good sense of humor
- ##### What do you dislike? 
No any GUI console for admin, but it was the requirements by Ulno. 

### Team4_9
-  ##### What you like?
cool functionality was invented, such as a "limit on the use of money". Interesting GUI
- ##### What do you dislike? 
Refrain from comment

### Team5_10
-  ##### What you like?
Very simple design, very clear to the user. It didn't even take me an extra second to figure out what one or the other button does
In general, a very cool project was made and in fact it would be cool to have such an application in real life
- ##### What do you dislike? 
I have not seen a special feature of this project.

### Team13_14
-  ##### What you like?
Again, very simple design, very easy to use. Nice music in the background
- ##### What do you dislike? 
Speed of video and speech
