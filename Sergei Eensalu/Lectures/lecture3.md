## Lecture task 1: Curiosities in Object Diagrams

### Mark what you think is strange in the following diagram 1

![image](images/lecture_3_diagramm_1.png)

- associations
- attributes - Array in deck. This array break all logic of diagramm


### Mark what you think is strange in the following diagram 2

![image](images/lecture_3_diagramm_2.png)

 - object names - value is in the object name. So object name combine with class name and value. Better to use small laters 


### Mark what you think is strange in the following diagram 3

![image](images/lecture_3_diagramm_3.png)

- associations - connecton between Bank and Account  is wrong
- object names - Better to use small laters 

### Mark what you think is strange in the following diagram 4

![image](images/lecture_3_diagramm_4.png)

- attributes - ID is not nessesary for diagramms, it is needed for databases

Opening Notes

First Jonathan gave everyone some time to prepare and then started to pick randomly people who are going to give pros and cons.

### First Person Pro Notes 
 - It's easier to understand the system design. Thanks to class diagrams we can implement software design patterns to a system. It is really hard to do it just by coding because some people can’t imagine how the system is going to work.
### Second Person Con Notes 
 - Complicated relations make it hard to understand the diagram and it is easy to mix up relationship arrows.
### Third Person Pro Notes 
 - You can use class diagrams as a base for other diagrams.
### Fourth Person Con Notes 
 - It can take time for the developer to understand and to maintain it.
### FIfth Person Pro Notes
 - Good way to illustrate a system structure with a maximum information (very detailed)
### Sixth Person Con Notes 
 - Class diagram focuses on a static view of the system. Both designers and newcomers to the project will probably learn more from diagrams that focus on the behaviour, for instance state-diagrams or sequence-diagrams.
### Seventh Person Pro Notes
 - It’s easy to maintain at some point. Easy to add new classes, easy to modify attributes of classes.
### Moderator Summary Notes
 - Everybody was prepared and presented their arguments very well.
Note taker worked very efficiently.
### Round 1 Person Challenge/Question Notes
 - If the system is complicated and huge then it's not easy to understand.
### Round 1 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes
 - We can use design patterns to cope with the project.
### Round 2 Person Challenge/Question Notes
 - If you understand the cardinalities then it’s not that complicated.
### Round 2 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes
 - If you show this diagram to business people, who do not use this so often, then they can interpret it in a wrong way and for them is it worth the time to learn all the different types of relationships and the lines.
### Round 3 Person Challenge/Question Notes
 - Why not just skip it and use another diagram
### Round 3 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes
 - It's easier to make a class diagram for visualizing.


### Free discussion to find best points for and against
 - Since we had more time then we discussed more pros and cons:
    Good way to illustrate a system structure with a maximum information (very detailed)

    Class diagram focuses on a static view of the system. Both designers and newcomers to the project will probably learn more from diagrams that focus on the behaviour, for instance state-diagrams or sequence-diagrams.
### 2 Best For
 - Point 1: First Person Pro Notes’s argument
 - Point 2: Third Person Pro Notes’s argument
### 2 Best Against
 - Point 1: Sixth Person Con Notes’s argument
 - Point 2: Fourth Person Con Notes’s argument
