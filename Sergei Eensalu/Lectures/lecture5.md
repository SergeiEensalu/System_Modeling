##### 1 - The role of sysmod most importantly for the software architects 
##### 2 - The role of sysmod also mainly for the also mainly for the
##### 3 - The role of sysmod and a bit also for the maintaining software developers

In the first place, system modeling helps to divide a large project into subprojects and establish links and dependencies between components and blocks. This helps to make the software architecture as logical and convenient as possible for the rest of the structures of this software.

Secondly, it is very important that developers understand where which dependencies are coming from and what may happen now or in the future if this or that part of the code is changed and how this may affect software development.
The model is good is it help developers to code a good and logic project


After Ulrich opinion my opinion has changed only in a positive direction in relation to users, because everything that is not done for the end user. No user - no projects, no software, no diagrams and money

## Breakout

###  Opening Notes
Hello! We are going to talk about use case/persona diagrams.
### First Person Pro Notes 
Use Case Diagrams do not have a steep learning curve. Anyone can get started which is not the same for the other UML diagrams.
### Second Person Con Notes 
They can become outdated really fast because we need to update regularly when we have new features or functionality. It’s especially hard for Personas because updating these personas requires a lot of research and people. 
### Third Person Pro Notes 
A bridge between SWE and non-technical people in terms of understanding the system. It is extremely simplified and useful for communication.
### Fourth Person Con Notes
Use Case Diagrams can get visually messy as the system grows.
### Moderator Summary Notes
Reinforced that Use Case Diagrams are a maintenance nightmare - Very time consuming to keep it updated
### Round 1 Person Challenge/Question Notes
In bigger systems, the visual diagrams can get very messy. Lots of lines cross each other and give so much confusion
### Round 1 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes
If we did use-case diagrams for each use-case of the system instead of the system as a whole, this removes the complexity.
### Round 2 Person Challenge/Question Notes
It’s such a simple diagram that updating it is quite easy. Also, the system does not get updated in big chunks so that it is easy to change.
### Round 2 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes
If the system is really complex and big then there’s an issue. The research that is involved in each change is really messy. When use cases change, the research being personas are issues. It’s not just about drawing the diagrams.
### Round 3 Person Challenge/Question Notes 
A trap as it doesn’t have a good technical interpretation that a developer can use.
### Round 3 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes 
Use Case Diagrams should be used for what they are good for, as a way to map out use cases. They are not created to support developers implementation. They work well with other diagrams.

### Free discussion to find best points for and against

### New points:
- Flexibility can lead to misinterpretation due to lack of technical details.
- When use case diagrams are used with other tools like user stories and personas, they are extremely powerful and help with interpretation.

### 2 Best For
Point 1: Easy to get started
Point 2: A bridge between non-technical people and SWEs
### 2 Best Against
Point 1: Flexibility can lead to misinterpretation due to lack of technical details.
Point 2: The problem with research on each change makes updating terrible.
