# Lecture 7

## Breakout

###  Opening Notes
Debating about State diagrams. Object is defined as states and these states change on different events.

###  First Person Pro Notes 
Model checking : method for finding if the model of a system represents what is the required behavior.

###  Second Person Con Notes
Difficult to maintain, if the system changes you have to change the diagram.This requires time.

### Third Person Pro Notes 
Useful for all development phases, even in testing. 

###  Fourth Person Con Notes 
Notation is strict and should be respected. Any input combination that is missing can lead to a deadlock .

###  Moderator Summary Notes
Great team-work.  

###  Round 1 Person Challenge/Question Notes
If the chart gets complicated it can be hard to catch the behaviour of the system. 

###  Round 1 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes
If that happens , we can split a system chart into  many subsystem’s chart.

###  Round 2 Person Challenge/Question Notes
Is it really that hard to change and maintain? Only adding or removing states is required which doesn’t seem that hard.

###  Round 2 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes
1.Just the fact that you have to come back to the chart many times and reflect the changes makes it difficult enough. Developers should be focused on writing code.
2.A lot of new states makes diagram unreadable and to avoid that you would have to know more difficult notations in state diagrams like parallel states, hierarchy, guards

###  Round 3 Person Challenge/Question Notes
Do developers actually use or check state charts before writing code ? That would be more valid in a sequence diagram.

###  Round 3 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes
Developers don’t generally look at charts because of how they learn in schools/ universities. This is not related to chart diagrams.

###  Free discussion to find best points for and against
All the points were discussed .

###  2 Best For
Point 1: Can be used for testing.

Point 2: Model checking

###  2 Best Against
Point 1: Not following notation correctly can lead to deadlocks

Point 2: Hard to maintain.
