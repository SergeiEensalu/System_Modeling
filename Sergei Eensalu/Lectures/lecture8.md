# Lecture 8

## Breakout

###  Opening Notes
We will discuss activity diagrams. 

###  First Person Pro Notes 
Can be used to generate the code.

###  Second Person Con Notes
Confusion between activity diagrams and state charts. If you don't know what is what there might be confusion. 

###  Third Person Pro Notes 
Activity diagrams are easy to read and learn. 

###  Fourth Person Con Notes
Complex conditional logic can make the diagrams hard to read

###  Moderator Summary Notes
Now we have all the pros and cons which are quite good. Let’s proceed with challenges.

###  Round 1 Person Challenge/Question Notes
Generated code is not that useful, it seems to be basic.  

###  Round 1 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes 
It does not generate the whole logic but at least it gives the basic and start level. For example if you have 30 or more classes you do get the relations and fundamentals. Makes it harder to make mistakes. 

###  Round 2 Person Challenge/Question Notes 
Can be confusing in the beginning, but both are easy enough to learn. For sure if you don't know what they are then you might mix them. If you have at least basic understanding you won't confuse them. 

###  Round 2 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes 
Someone who does not use them daily they still are confusing. If a non-tech person wants to understand can be confusing. 

###  Round 3 Person Challenge/Question Notes
Readability of activity diagrams are easy if they are not that big. They can be complex when learning there are notations (guards, synchronization, ….) hard to understand these at the first time. 

###  Round 3 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes
Notation is simple. But if you put everything together in the diagram it becomes hard to understand and read.


###  Free discussion to find best points for and against
Very intuitive for procedural programmers. We discussed which ones are the best pros and cons. Then we had some extra time and started talking about the question from the lecture: "What are we winning or losing with activity diagram vs  imperative code? (Why?)”

###  2 Best For
Point 1: First Person Pro Can be used to generate the code 
Point 2: Third Person Pro Activity diagrams are easy to read and learn

###  2 Best Against
Point 1: Second Person Con Confusion between activity diagrams and state charts. If you don't know what is what there might be confusion. 
Point 2: Fourth Person Con Complex conditional logic can make the diagrams hard to read
