# Reflections of week 1 : Object Diagram

## Lecture Reflection
The first lecture began with an introduction to the instructor and a quick overview of
the entire course. We were told what we will do during the course, what awaits us and
what we will learn, as well as explained the assessment system and the environment
where we will communicate and work.

The first lecture seemed to me very confusing and difficult, it was
very difficult to get into the rhythm (tempo) and those innovations that
were used in the lecture. After the lecture, I was a little confused
and therefore spent a couple of hours in the evening in order to
sort out the first lecture and prepare for the next.

I liked that the students were involved during the lecture

## Lab Reflection
After the lecture, there was a bit of a confused state that turned into a practical lesson. 
The first practical lesson we got to know the team, tried to understand what we need to do and began to calmly do the task. Everything went well, because the guys from the team were able to explain the task
