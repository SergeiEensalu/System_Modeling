# Reflections of week 1 : Object Diagram

## Lecture Reflection
The first lecture began with an introduction to the instructor and a quick overview of
the entire course. We were told what we will do during the course, what awaits us and
what we will learn, as well as explained the assessment system and the environment
where we will communicate and work.

The first lecture seemed to me very confusing and difficult, it was
very difficult to get into the rhythm (tempo) and those innovations that
were used in the lecture. After the lecture, I was a little confused
and therefore spent a couple of hours in the evening in order to
sort out the first lecture and prepare for the next.

I liked that the students were involved during the lecture

## Lab Reflection
After the lecture, there was a bit of a confused state that turned into a practical lesson. 
The first practical lesson we got to know the team, tried to understand what we need to do and began to calmly do the task. Everything went well, because the guys from the team were able to explain the task


## Object Diagrams my opinion

Object diagram in the unified modeling language is a diagram that shows a complete or partial view of the structure of a modeled system at a specific time.

Object diagrams are really widespread in real life system modelling, because of their advantages. List the most important ones below 

Object diagrams are often used before building a system they clearly demonstrate the connections between systems objects. This makes life easier for developers. In the future when they will implement the system these graphs become really useful. It is a well-known fact the more time you spend on analyzing and creating a model of your future system the less issues you will have third.

Object diagrams are useful to explain smaller portions of your system. Before creating a system object diagrams can be used just for discovering texts about the most specific model elements and their links. You can extract the exact part of your application and try to print it with the using of object diagram. For instance if your system requires transactions you can use object diagrams specifically for that part. Print object and its properties then create the connections between them.

Object diagrams are also used to create examples or snapshots of your objects in a system at a point in a time. So it's not abstract you can create object diagrams by instantiating the classifiers in class deployment, component and use case diagrams. You can easily change the size or scope of an object diagram. 


## Group 5 Object Diagram props

- snapshot of system at the point of time
- can be used for making the prototype of a system
- are used for small part of the system
- not abstract
- easy to change the size of score of an Object Diagram
- Can be used in different test cases
- Easy to understand

## Group 1 Object Diagram cons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NddvBlbTsR8
- quality of the diagram depends a lot on the experience of the programmer
- a lot of difference nouns that in future will be separate object
- only for object oriented languages, not fot functional languages
- in the large systems - difficult to read and understand

## Group 3 Object Diagram cons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10qdRMpAba0&feature=youtu.be
- Useless now a days
- Large system - hard to read
- Refactoring an object diagram costs money and time
- Model-Code Gap
