# Reflections of week 11

## Lecture Reflection
I really liked this lecture. Professor Marlon spoke at this lecture. I was familiar with him before and crossed paths on several subjects. A very interesting lecture from him about the processes in large companies and how thousands of others are formed from one process. Very interesting lecture, in the near future I will even revise it
