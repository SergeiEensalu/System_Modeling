# Reflections of week 12

## Lecture Reflection
This lecture was, as always, very interesting. The lecture format has become customary. We listen to the teacher, do some small five-minute tasks and write answers to the chat. Listening to the teacher again. Then we work in a group, discussing the topic of the lecture. After that, we return to the teacher and listen to him further.


## Lab Reflection
The team has done a tremendous amount of work this week. I would even say that we did essentially the whole project in one week, since everyone worked very hard and did all their tasks.

As for me -> several tasks were assigned to me, I started to do and did. Spent about two days. When I started looking at the backlog, I realized that my task was three times less than I did. I accidentally grabbed other assignments and did them. It happened by accident, because I can't read my assignment normally.
