# Reflections of week 13

## Lecture Reflection
This lecture was, as always, very interesting. The lecture format has become customary. We listen to the teacher, do some small five-minute tasks and write answers to the chat. Listening to the teacher again. Then we work in a group, discussing the topic of the lecture. After that, we return to the teacher and listen to him further.


## Lab Reflection
we did a very good job last week with the team and so almost everything was done. There are some small details left for this week. For example, I slightly altered the sequence diagrams to make sure 100% was correct. I had no more assignments this week. But at the end of the week they still found me what I could do, but I have not had time yet
