# Reflections of week 15

## Lecture Reflection
In this lecture we looked at each team's draft and discussed what is good and what could be better. 
I really liked the ideas and work with the project. Generally a very cool way of teaching. We work just like a real team, just like at work and we get paid for it. It was nice that at the end of the project the entire project was completed and we created a presentation to protect this project. Each team tried to do very unique things by adding cool scripts, jokes, pictures, gags and so on. It turned out very interesting


I shed a tear at the moment where Ulno and Asuya thanked everyone. It was really very interesting and funny and probably one of the most useful courses. I would like all courses to be in this format
