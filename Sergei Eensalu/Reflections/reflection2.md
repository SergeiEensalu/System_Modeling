# Reflections of week 2 : Class Diagram

## Lecture Reflection

I liked the second lecture much more than the first. I already knew what we were doing and what awaited me. I liked that ULNO had already recorded videos that we watched. The work in the group was very interesting, where we discussed the pros and cons

## Lab Reflection
In practice, my team and I did all the necessary tasks very quickly. Everyone worked. We felt great. Felt support and help from the team


## Class Diagrams my opinion

A class diagram is a type of an uml diagram that describes the static structure of a system or a part of a system a class diagram consists of classes their attributes with their respective types  and the cardinality relationships between the different classes of the diagram

Looking back to object diagrams class diagrams could be considered the next logical step of modelling a system logical step of modelling a system.

In comparison to object diagrams you could use class diagrams to generalize
an object diagram that has grown too large or messy. Also it should be considered that the audience should be able to handle the more abstract way of expression.

class diagrams can help to discuss more concrete details of a very high level diagram

- provide detail overview about the different classes, connections of structure of system
- simple and fast to read
- easy to create and modify

## Group 7 Class Diagram props

- 1 on 1 mapping with the implementation layer
- Very concise and expressive
- Can be turned to code and can be generated from code
- Easy to maintain (add new class, modify attributes, and change the hierarchy)
- Cardinalities 
. Good for structuring data

## Group 6 & 2  Class Diagram cons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc4wLVmrQ6k&feature=youtu.be
- if very-very large system - diagram is not readable 
- Using all annotation, relationships and meenings between the classes get complicated and massive
- inheritance is an evil, because if you change something in the base class, you have an intendent side effect in subclass
- infinite cyclic association
- unnecessary complexity 
- A cycle of association relations, which includes an association class
- Poor aesthetics
