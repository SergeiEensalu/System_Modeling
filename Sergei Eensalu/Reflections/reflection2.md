#Reflections of Lecture 1

## Lecture Reflection

I liked the second lecture much more than the first. I already knew what we were doing and what awaited me. I liked that ULNO had already recorded videos that we watched. The work in the group was very interesting, where we discussed the pros and cons

## Lab Reflection
In practice, my team and I did all the necessary tasks very quickly. Everyone worked. We felt great. Felt support and help from the team
