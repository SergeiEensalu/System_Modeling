# Reflections of week 3

## Lecture Reflection
Two things I liked the most this time. The first is that we considered at the beginning of the lecture some examples of diagrams that we ourselves made. We looked at it from different angles and came to a common opinion on what was done well and what was wrong. The one thing that I really liked was that for about 30 minutes the lecturer wrote code in Java. I even have fond memories of those times when I was just learning to program in Java. In this course, we could write more code. 

Next time it would be nice if we could finish the lecture on time


## Lab Reflection

We worked with the team for 2 hours. Unfortunately, we did not manage to complete all the tasks that were given to us during the practice, and therefore we agreed on Friday evening to continue doing the tasks and finish them to the end. On Friday evening, we sat for about 2.5 hours more to do the entire practice assignment.

The tasks were interesting, but they took a lot of time. It's great that we have the opportunity to write code in practice. I love writing code more than writing plain text


## Component Diagrams my opinion

Component diagrams show how software objects are categorized to form larger components. 
Component diagrams provide a simplified high order view of a large system by classifying a group of software 
objects as a component the entire system becomes more modular as components may be interchanged and reused. 
The simplicity allows component diagrams to be used as a communication tool between the developer and different 
stakeholders. Component diagrams can also be used to create a roadmap for an implementation.

- Is useful to understand the system as it answers questions as: 

        - What the main components of the system ? 
        
        - How is the system decomposed ?
        
        - How do there components interact with each other from the static viewpoint of the service
            that they provide and require
- Simplify the high level of the system 
- Supports Revers-Engineering
- A "selfie" of the software architecture

- Can see the software project from a hight level
- Helps  to understands the code
- Good for a wide range of applications 

## Group 12 Component Diagram cons

- if logic of interfaces is changed, difficult to maintain the diagram
- not abstract enough 

## Group 13 Component Diagram cons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmjxVekJ78g&feature=youtu.be
- Are not abstract nor the real system
- in the simple systems class diagram might be enough 
- The same idea can be conveyed in multiple ways
- One component can be shown in at least 4 different ways 
- Synonymity
- Hard to do well
