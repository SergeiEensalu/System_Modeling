# Reflections of week 3

## Lecture Reflection
Two things I liked the most this time. The first is that we considered at the beginning of the lecture some examples of diagrams that we ourselves made. We looked at it from different angles and came to a common opinion on what was done well and what was wrong. The one thing that I really liked was that for about 30 minutes the lecturer wrote code in Java. I even have fond memories of those times when I was just learning to program in Java. In this course, we could write more code. 

Next time it would be nice if we could finish the lecture on time


## Lab Reflection

We worked with the team for 2 hours. Unfortunately, we did not manage to complete all the tasks that were given to us during the practice, and therefore we agreed on Friday evening to continue doing the tasks and finish them to the end. On Friday evening, we sat for about 2.5 hours more to do the entire practice assignment.

The tasks were interesting, but they took a lot of time. It's great that we have the opportunity to write code in practice. I love writing code more than writing plain text


## Class Diagrams my opinion

A class diagram is a type of an uml diagram that describes the static structure of a system or a part of a system a class diagram consists of classes their attributes with their respective types  and the cardinality relationships between the different classes of the diagram

Looking back to object diagrams class diagrams could be considered the next logical step of modelling a system logical step of modelling a system.

In comparison to object diagrams you could use class diagrams to generalize
an object diagram that has grown too large or messy. Also it should be considered that the audience should be able to handle the more abstract way of expression.

class diagrams can help to discuss more concrete details of a very high level diagram

## Group 12 Class Diagram props

- provide detail overview about the different classes, connections of structure of system
- simple and fast to read
- easy to create and modify

## Group 7 Class Diagram props

- 1 on 1 mapping with the implementation layer
- Very concise and expressive
- Can be turned to code and can be generated from code
- Easy to maintain (add new class, modify attributes, and change the hierarchy)
- Cardinalities 
. Good for structuring data

## Group 6 & 2  Class Diagram cons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc4wLVmrQ6k&feature=youtu.be
- if very-very large system - diagram is not readable 
- Using all annotation, relationships and meenings between the classes get complicated and massive
- inheritance is an evil, because if you change something in the base class, you have an intendent side effect in subclass
- infinite cyclic association
- unnecessary complexity 
- A cycle of association relations, which includes an association class
- Poor aesthetics
