# Reflections of week 4

## Lecture Reflection
I had a force majeure situation and I had to urgently leave for Tallinn. I watched the lecture 
and participated in it about 85% of the time of the entire lecture. The lecture was on the topic 
of diagram components and code. I found this lecture very interesting and productive. The lecturer 
showed very interesting things related to the code. For example, how to generate code based on diagrams.
 A week later, I reviewed the lecture again to refresh my knowledge of this topic.

## Lab Reflection

For some serious ASAP reasons, I was not able to participate in this week's practice, 
but the guys and I agreed that I would do a certain part of the practice to be honest with everyone. 
The volume of practice seemed to me a bit large and it went beyond 2 hours ...


## Component Diagrams my opinion

Component diagrams can be seen as one step up on the abstraction ladder in comparison to the class 
diagrams as each component can be implemented by one or more classes.
A component is like a subsystem which communicates with other parts of the bigger system. 
All components can provide and need different interfaces such a relationship is represented with a connector. 
For example the order component needs an item code which the product component can provide
in this connection indicated by the


The component diagram allows you to determine the composition of software components, which are the source, binary and executable code, as well as to install between them.
A component is a physical part of a system. Components, which are files with source code of classes, libraries, executable modules, etc., which must have a consistent set of interfaces. The following graphic symbols are used to represent them graphically.



## Component Diagrams my opinion

Component diagrams show how software objects are categorized to form larger components. 
Component diagrams provide a simplified high order view of a large system by classifying a group of software 
objects as a component the entire system becomes more modular as components may be interchanged and reused. 
The simplicity allows component diagrams to be used as a communication tool between the developer and different 
stakeholders. Component diagrams can also be used to create a roadmap for an implementation.

- Is useful to understand the system as it answers questions as: 

        - What the main components of the system ? 
        
        - How is the system decomposed ?
        
        - How do there components interact with each other from the static viewpoint of the service
            that they provide and require
- Simplify the high level of the system 
- Supports Revers-Engineering
- A "selfie" of the software architecture

- Can see the software project from a hight level
- Helps  to understands the code
- Good for a wide range of applications

- if logic of interfaces is changed, difficult to maintain the diagram
- not abstract enough 

## Group 13 Component Diagram cons

- Are not abstract nor the real system
- in the simple systems class diagram might be enough 
- The same idea can be conveyed in multiple ways
- One component can be shown in at least 4 different ways 
- Synonymity
- Hard to do well
