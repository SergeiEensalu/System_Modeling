# Reflections of Lecture 4

## Lecture Reflection
I had a force majeure situation and I had to urgently leave for Tallinn. I watched the lecture 
and participated in it about 85% of the time of the entire lecture. The lecture was on the topic 
of diagram components and code. I found this lecture very interesting and productive. The lecturer 
showed very interesting things related to the code. For example, how to generate code based on diagrams.
 A week later, I reviewed the lecture again to refresh my knowledge of this topic.

## Lab Reflection

For some serious ASAP reasons, I was not able to participate in this week's practice, 
but the guys and I agreed that I would do a certain part of the practice to be honest with everyone. 
The volume of practice seemed to me a bit large and it went beyond 2 hours ...

Component diagrams can be seen as one step up on the abstraction ladder in comparison to the class 
diagrams as each component can be implemented by one or more classes.
A component is like a subsystem which communicates with other parts of the bigger system. 
All components can provide and need different interfaces such a relationship is represented with a connector. 
For example the order component needs an item code which the product component can provide
in this connection indicated by the


The component diagram allows you to determine the composition of software components, which are the source, binary and executable code, as well as to install between them.
A component is a physical part of a system. Components, which are files with source code of classes, libraries, executable modules, etc., which must have a consistent set of interfaces. The following graphic symbols are used to represent them graphically.
