# Reflections of week 5

## Lecture Reflection
This lecture talked about such a new (for me) thing as Personas. Before that, I had never met such a concept 
anywhere and did not think about it. As always, no criticism for today's lecture, it was very interesting.
I like the questionnaires that pass during the lecture, since the lecturer explains certain things based on our real opinions. 
It seems to me that this is very helpful in learning and understanding the concept of a topic.

## Lab Reflection
This week has been challenging enough. The guys and I did the practical tasks, since we did not have time to do the most part,
we agreed that everyone will do some basic part and then we will meet on Saturday and discuss and finish the biggest task, 
which is called Mancala Controller and Tests. On Saturday we agreed to meet at 9 am and spend approximately 1.5 hours. 
To our surprise, the task took 4 hours, because we sat with him until 13 in the afternoon and all exactly one block remained uncompleted. 
Therefore, we agreed that we will continue on Sundays. All other tasks, except for Mancala Controller and Tests, do not seem very difficult 
and large, but they all take time.

#### Use case modeling: 

Use case is a written description of how users will perform tasks on your system. It outlines from user's point of view a
system's behavior as it responds to a request each use case is represented as a sequence of simple steps beginning with the user's goal and
ending when that goal is fulfilled. A uml use case diagram is the primary form of a system or software requirements for a new
software program underdeveloped. Use cases specify the expected behavior and not the exact method of making it happen. 
A key concept of use case modeling is that it helps us design a system from the end user's perspective. Use case diagrams
are typically developed in the early stage of development and people often apply use case modeling for the following purposes.

#### Persona modeling:
A persona defines an archetypical user of a system. An example of the kind of person who would interact with it.
In a nutshell personas are an answer to the observation that the designer who tries to please everybody ends up pleasing
nobody, because too many compromises kill the product's integrity. Instead personas provide designers and developers with an anchor for justifying
design choices by answering questions such as what Amanda would do or whether Bob will understand.
