# Reflections of week 6

## Lecture Reflection
This lecture was, as always, very interesting. The lecture format has become customary. We listen to the teacher, do some small five-minute tasks and write answers to the chat. Listening to the teacher again. Then we work in a group, discussing the topic of the lecture. After that, we return to the teacher and listen to him further and at the end the lecturer shows the practical part that awaits us further in practice


## Lab Reflection
Practice went as usual - very interesting and fun. With Sander and Karmen, we did all the practice assignments. This week we did everything quickly and we had almost nothing left of the tasks, so this week we began to prepare for the video presentation, which we will have only in two weeks. We thought over most of the video and made the text and slides, it remains to record the whole thing

Sequence diagrams

Sequence diagrams are used to show how and in which order different objects work together
Often a diagram is related with one certain use case. Each diagram has two dimensions the
horizontal axis which represents the object dimension and vertical axis represents the time dimension.
Objects are usually arranged from left to right depending on the order in which they take part in the message
sequence and the time progresses from the upper edge of the diagram downwards. So the latest events are
always at the bottom of the diagram.
