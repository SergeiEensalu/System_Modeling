## State Charts opinion

It shows how an object moves from one state to another. State diagrams are used to model the dynamic aspects of a system. 
This diagram is useful for modeling the life cycle of an object. The state diagram differs from other diagrams in that it 
describes the process of changing the states of only one instance of a certain class - one object, moreover, a reactive object, 
that is, an object whose behavior is characterized by its response to external events.
