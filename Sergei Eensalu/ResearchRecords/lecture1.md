# Before the lecture task

#### Which types of diagrams are mentioned in the talk?
- UML
- “The shopping list”;
- Boxes & No Lines diagrams;
- The “Function view”;
- The Airline Route Map;
- Generically True;
- The “Logical View”;
- Homeless Old C# Object (HOCO)

#### What is the standard for modeling software mentioned in the movie?
Four plus one model (logical view, development view, psychical view, use cases),

#### Why is nobody using it?
People find hard to visualise, share and communicate their software systems, they don’t know how to use UML right, it is too complex and low level

#### What is the model-code gap and what is the problem with it?
Difference between architecture model and source code, where architecture model and source code show not the same things.

#### How do you think about Systems Modeling after watching this movie?
The diagrams are basically pointless, we are just deceiving ourselves we have with creating like an alternate reality about how we think the system should look, but it doesn’t .
