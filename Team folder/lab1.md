4. Abstract – some high-level notion or idea that can encompass a range of examples but does not specify any explicitly

    Concrete – some low-level object or idea that represents a certain state of a certain element

    Example – a specification of some object/notion/idea that provides helpful illustration of a topic

    In the field of systems modeling, the abstract versus concrete differentiation is important because in some cases, the situation calls for an abstract representation of a system while in others, we would need a concrete description of a system state, e.g. to illustrate some aspects to the client. 

### Exercise 1.6.2.1
Four additional rules for Mau Mau:
1.	Before the start of the game, a player who is not the dealer cuts the deck 4 times. If they cut 1-3 significant cards, they are allowed to keep them if they want. However, if four cards where the cards are cut are found to be power cards, the deck needs to be reshuffled and the cut is repeated.
2.	When a player has only one card left, he must say “Mau” (even if it is an Ace); if that card is a Jack, he must say “Mau-Mau”. Failure means that the player must take a card.
3.	If an Ace is played, one other card must be played with it. If the player does not have another card, or cannot follow in suit or number, then the player must take a card from the pack. If your final card is an Ace, you cannot win on that turn.
4.	If the game is scored, and the winning card is a Jack, then all points against the losers are doubled.

Eight examples for Mau Mau situations:
1.	Mary plays an H9. John plays after Mary and can thus play either a 9 from any suit or any card from the suit of hearts or a Jack.
2.	John plays a DJ. He can now announce a suit which has to be played next. John announces spades. Tim plays after John and has to play any card from the suit of spades or another Jack.
3.	Tim plays an S8. This means that the next player, Judy, skips their turn and the turn goes again to Mary.
4.	Mary does not have an 8 of any suit nor any card from the suit of spades nor any Jack. She has to draw one card from the drawing stack. Mary draws an S10 and can play it right away, but she also has the right to keep it.
5.	John plays an SA and right after that also an SQ, because if an Ace is played, one other card must be played with it.
6.	Tim plays a DQ and is left with only one card. He says “Mau” because if he didn’t, he would have to draw a card. He doesn’t have a Jack, so “Mau” is sufficient.
7.	Mary plays a D8 and is left with only one card, a HJ. She says “Mau-Mau” because if she didn’t, she would have to draw a card.
8.	John plays a DA and is left with just one card, so he says “Mau”. Since he just played an Ace, he also plays his second card, thus he gets rid of all his cards and wins the game.
