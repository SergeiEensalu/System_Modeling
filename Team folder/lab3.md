# Matching exercise

* Allowed object diagrams:  A, C

B is not allowed because an object of class C is associated with two objects
of class B which is not allowed according to the 0...1 cardinality association
on the class diagram. D and E are not allowed because objects of class C
are associated with another object of class C which is not documented on the class diagram.

* Invalid elements: diagram B: c connected with two B objects, D: c and c2; E: c and c2

* On diagram A, link between c and b1 should be "has". On diagram B, the link between b1 and b2 could be labelled with "contains",
and between c and b1 "has", between c and b2 "has". On diagram C, link between c and b1
should be "has". On diagram D, link between c and b1 should be "has".

* Object diagram confirming to the given class diagram:
