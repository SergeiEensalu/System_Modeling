###Software architecture vs code
Think and answer the following questions (and keep a digital document of this for your portfolio):
- Which types of diagrams are mentioned in the talk?
The commonly seen types that software companies tend to produce: boxes, the airline route map, the “generally true” diagrams which state the obvious, etc. Also, UML diagrams
- What is the standard for modeling software mentioned in the movie?
UML (Unifies Modeling Language)
- Why is nobody using it?
Too complex, too low-level, agile developers don’t use it (although they should)
- What is the model-code gap and what is the problem with it?
The models depict different things than what the code includes. It usually comes from the fact that we organize our code with regard to classes, namespaces, etc., but we use different structures in the models.
- What do you personally think about layers for modeling software?
I think it might not always be possible to isolate the layers as the layered architecture suggests, therefore it is not the best approach every time, but there are definitely cases where it is beneficial.
- How do you think about Systems Modeling after watching this movie?
I see more benefit in modeling the architecture than I did before – the lecture made me think about how we structure our code and think about it.
- Anything else remarkable from the movie, we should share/discuss?

####Introduction
From Systems Modeling, I expect to learn how to reasonably structure a software development cycle, to learn about design patterns, how to create documentation that is useful (diagrams). I have created some diagrams and use cases previously, not much experience with modeling though

My name is Karmen and I’m not actually in SE Master’s but in Computer Science instead. 

*Note: did not have time to answer the rest of the personal questions*

What is software architecture?

“In simple words, software architecture is the process of converting software characteristics such as flexibility, scalability, feasibility, reusability, and security into a structured solution that meets the technical and the business expectations.”
